                        <p>The Alliance for Progress, a coalition of progressive minor parties, has written to the leaders of all major parties in Australia to urge a sensible but democratic approach to the way Senators are elected in Australia. Alliance members believe that voters should have the opportunity to number as few as six boxes below-the-line (BTL) on their Senate ballot paper. This will make it easier for voters to show their preferences and will be less confusing and will avoid wasted votes.
                        </p>
 
                        <p>'Voters currently only have the option to vote with a single number above the line, or to number all of the boxes BTL, which may mean numbering as many as 100 boxes', said James Jansson, Leader of the Science Party (formerly the Future Party) and Alliance for Progress organiser. 'Optional BTL preferences give voters the freedom to customise their preference flows easily.'
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Sex Party leader and Victorian Upper House MP, Fiona Patten, said such a change would leave the major parties open to a charge of 'gaming the system' - something they have previously tried to hang on the minor parties. 'There is a considerable amount of ill-will developing in progressive minor parties towards the Greens for pushing an agenda that will make it impossible for any minor party to be elected', she said. 'The Greens need to remind themselves that many of their state seats are only won through preferential support from minor parties and the blowback from this federal campaign could be significant'.
                        </p>

                        <p>Animal Justice Party MLC in the NSW Parliament, Mark Pearson, said Australians would be justifiably wary of electoral changes proposed by any governing party.  "We should not be surprised to find them promoting amendments that are designed to favour themselves rather than the electorate and our multi-party democracy", he said.
                        </p>

                        <p>The changes being put by the Alliance avoid some of the downfalls of optional above-the-line (ATL) preferencing. "We believe that optional above-the-line preferences would lead to substantial voter confusion at the next election, in particular many people will not understand that their preferences will not flow automatically', Dr Jansson said. 'This is demonstrated in elections such as in NSW, where 80-85% of people risk some or all of their vote being wasted because they do not indicate any preferences'.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The Alliance claims that the votes of people who don't list their preferences effectively only count for a fraction of their full value. If a voter only votes 1 above the line and their chosen party is eliminated, then their vote is completely wasted if they believed their vote would flow. Marginalised groups are more likely to have their votes wasted through the confusion of a changing system.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Ms Patten said that the proposed optional ATL probably has constitutional issues. "The Senate vote is not about electing a party it is about the individual. And in this has been highlighted by John Maddigan, Jacqui Lambie and Glenn Lazarus all leaving the party they were elected under."
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Dr Jansson said that Optional ATL voting is a massive disincentive to diversity among parties because it results in a splitting of the vote. 'Splitting of the vote will affect minor parties, but it will also affect major parties including Labor and the Greens, who have overlapping voter demographics', he said.
                        </p>

                        <p>Mr Pearson said that the Prime Minister was fond of saying that we need a 'government for the 21st Century'. "We are in an era of new ideas and more ethical practices and its time electors had a proper choice at election time to bring this new order into our parliamentary system of government. How can this occur if all we have are the same tired old political parties? We need choice in diversity to generate new ideas and momentum."
                        </p>

                        <p>Dr Jansson said that optional preferential BTL voting was likely to reduce the costs and time needed to count senate votes, as well as reducing the time that BTL voters would need to fill in their ballot papers. He said it would also be likely to reduce the rate of accidental informal voting among people who do not fill in all boxes below the line.'
