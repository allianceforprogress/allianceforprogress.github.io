				<h2>About the Alliance for Progress</h2>
				<p class="lead">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut <br> et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam</p>

					<h2>What is the Alliance for Progress?</h2>

					<p>The Alliance for Progress is a group of like-minded progressive and future-focussed minor parties who have come together for the common good. The Alliance has three main objectives:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
						<p><strong>Collaborate on campaigns around specific issues of importance</strong> - together we can amplify our message and reach a wider audience than by acting independently.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p><strong>Share resources and ideas</strong> - running a small party is tough, so helping each other out can save everyone time, energy and money.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p><strong>Strengthen ties and facilitate a forum for negotiating preferencing agreements on the basis of principles and policy similarities</strong> - for all political parties, forming preferencing agreements with other parties is an important part of the lead-up to an election. The Alliance is about creating an open and honest forum which will increase the probability that someone who shares &nbsp;progressive values will ultimately be elected to parliament.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>How does the Alliance work?</h2>

					<p>Representatives of the Alliance parties meet monthly to discuss current issues, ideas for campaigns, and ways we can better collaborate.</p>

					<p>Any member of the Alliance can suggest an idea for a campaign and other parties can then decide whether or not they would like to support it. Those parties who wish to participate in the campaign will then work together to agree on a message, coordinate social media and other activity, and give a stronger voice to their message.</p>

					<p>When the time comes to negotiate preferencing agreements in the lead-up to an election, the Alliance will serve as a friendly forum for facilitating communication among parties. Whilst there is no requirement for Alliance members to preference other Alliance members ahead of non-members, there are two clear expectations of all:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
						<p>Preferencing agreements are to be negotiated in good faith</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>If an Alliance member decides to preference any non-member ahead of another Alliance member, they must notify that Alliance member of this in a timely manner.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>What does it mean to be a member of the Alliance?</h2>

					<p>The Alliance for Progress is not a formal coalition. None of the parties are required to support any particular campaign or policy position, and it is expected that not everyone will agree on every issue. In reality, the only thing holding the Alliance together is a shared understanding that working together will be to the benefit of all members.</p>

					<h2>How is the Alliance for Progress different to the Minor Party Alliance?</h2>

					<p>The Alliance for Progress is completely independent from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Party_Alliance">Minor Party Alliance</a> (MPA), although some members of the Alliance for Progress may also participate in the MPA. The key difference between the Alliance for Progress and the MPA is that the MPA is primarily focused on preference negotiations and can include a wide variety of parties with polar opposite views and policies. The Alliance for Progress however, is intended to facilitate cooperation between like-minded, progressive parties, and whilst this will most likely include negotiating preferencing agreements in the lead-up to elections, the objectives of the Alliance are much broader than this, including collaboration on campaigns around common issues and sharing of resources.</p>

					<p><br />
					There is no requirement for members of the Alliance for Progress to either be a part of, or not to be a part of, the MPA, and it expected that some Alliance for Progress members will choose to participate in the MPA and others will not.</p>
