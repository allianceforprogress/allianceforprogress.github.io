<p>The Alliance for Progress has initiated its first campaign to help bring about marriage equality. The Alliance for Progress is a group of forward-thinking political parties that formed in June of this year to work together on campaigns and help each other in elections.</p>

<p>Six registered parties (Arts Party, Secular Party, Australian Equality Party, Australian Progressives, Future Party and Pirate Party) and two unregistered parties (Transhumanist Party and Life Extension Science and Technology Party) are the first parties to publicly work together under the banner &lsquo;Alliance for Progress&rsquo; to defend the rights of the LGBTI community.</p>

<p>Remy Coll of the Australian Equality Party said, &ldquo;The overwhelming support for marriage equality cannot be ignored. We stand with the millions of Australians who demand equality, fairness and human rights in our government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>James Jansson, leader of the Future Party, said of the joint campaign, &quot;The parties involved in this campaign are a viable alternative to the two major parties that refuse to formally endorse marriage equality party-wide. The Liberal Party might have a plebiscite if they get re-elected. We believe that shows zero leadership on the issue. Bill Shorten has said he supports marriage equality, yet the vote isn&rsquo;t binding until 2017. If voters elect a senator from an Alliance for Progress Party involved in this campaign, they are guaranteed to vote for marriage equality. Voters can send a message by voting for parties that actually show leadership on this issue.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Looking at the Alliance for Progress, there&#39;s a core set of values we all pretty much agree on. More unites us than divides us in terms of values and principles, but we each have our unique way of operating as parties.&quot; said Nathan Lee, Policy Coordinator for the Australian Progressives. &quot;Marriage equality is a simple issue of fairness which most of us figured out some time back. Our membership overwhelmingly endorsed marriage equality.&quot;</p>

<p>The Secular Party has long supported the move towards ending discrimination on the basis of sexual preference. The party position has been that the Marriage Act, amended by the Howard Government for the sole purpose of denying same-sex couples the same rights as all other Australians, should be changed as soon as possible.</p>
